===============================

The task is to build a basic memory game. Display a 4x4 grid of the default image of your choice.
Allow the user to flip two images at a time to display the images you've fetched. If the images
match, leave them flipped over, otherwise flip them back. When the user has matched all the
images, display the number of flips it took and allow them to restart the game with new images.

    Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-
    suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on
    a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn
    over pairs of matching cards.

    
- All images need to be tagged with "kitten" and you should use the square size
- 4x4 grid of images with a placeholder until flipped
- Bonus points for using as few libraries as possible
- game is tracking and aware of victory state
- single page app
- Retrieve JSON from the api (not XML or JSONP)
